## 🔧 Detailed Implementation

### Tools Processed

#### 1. ❌ `get_enhanced_statistics` - REMOVED (Broken Tool)
- **Problem**: Hardcoded query "sample analysis" returning 0 results despite 99.95% actual enhancement coverage
- **Impact**: Misleading analytics causing confusion about system health
- **Solution**: Disabled tool + updated calling code to use `smart_metadata_sync_status` directly
- **Result**: Analytics now show correct 99.95% enhancement coverage

#### 2. ❌ `get_file_watcher_status` - REMOVED (Legacy Tool)
- **Problem**: Dead code from deprecated file watcher system (already disabled)
- **Impact**: Cluttered codebase with non-functional legacy code
- **Solution**: Complete removal of function and references
- **Result**: Clean codebase with no legacy dead code

#### 3. ⚠️ `get_vector_db_health` - DISABLED + COMPATIBILITY LAYER
- **Problem**: Redundant functionality superseded by comprehensive version
- **Impact**: Tool duplication with 40+ external references
- **Solution**: Disabled from MCP but added compatibility layer redirecting to `get_system_health_report`
- **Result**: External integrations preserved while encouraging migration to enhanced version
